### Maze Solver Overview

The **Maze Solver** is a Python-based application designed to find the shortest path through a grid-based maze using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm. The maze is represented as a two-dimensional grid where cells can either be passable or blocked. Starting from an initial point, the solver navigates through the maze to reach a specified endpoint, ensuring the path found is the shortest.

### Algorithm Choice

The **Breadth-First Search** algorithm was chosen for its guaranteed ability to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, making it ideal for this project. The maze is treated as a graph where each cell is a node, and valid moves between cells form edges. BFS explores all possible moves from the starting point layer by layer, systematically checking each level of nodes before proceeding deeper.

### Implementation Details

The implementation involves queue-based traversal, where each cell is dequeued, and its unvisited neighbors are enqueued. A visited set ensures no cell is revisited, optimizing the search process. The algorithm also records the path to each cell, enabling reconstruction of the shortest path once the endpoint is reached. Edge cases like mazes with no solution or multiple paths are handled gracefully.

### User Experience

The solver visualizes the maze, highlighting the explored cells and the final path, providing users with an intuitive understanding of how BFS works. Input flexibility allows users to create custom mazes or use predefined examples. This interactive approach enhances both engagement and learning, making the project a practical tool for algorithm visualization.

### Learning Outcomes

Developing the Maze Solver reinforced my understanding of graph traversal algorithms and their practical applications. It honed my skills in data structures such as queues and sets, as well as debugging and optimizing search-based solutions. This project demonstrates my ability to solve complex problems efficiently while creating educational and user-friendly software.
